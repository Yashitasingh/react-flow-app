# Getting Started with Create React App
This project is a dynamic React application utilizing React Flow to create and manage interactive node-based workflows. Users can drag and drop nodes, showcasing a simple yet effective interface for visualizing processes or data flows.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
